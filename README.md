# INF224 project by Thomas Auguste

This code is my project report for INF224 course in Telecom Paris. This course focuses on Programmation Paradigms and on Java and C++ programming skills.

## The app

The aim of the project was to develop a multimedia set-top box software that could be used to display photos, play music, videos and films.
There is the backend part and the frontend part. The frontend part creates a remote control for the set-top box and is developped using Java/Swing for graphical interfaces.
The backend part is developed using C++.

## Run the app

First, open 2 terminals (one for frontend and one for backend). Then compile and run each part.

### For backend :
```
cd cpp
make
make run myprog
```

### For frontend :
```
cd swing
make
make run
```
